## Abstract:


The rapid development of technologies leads us to careful planning for the best choice.  These technologies and innovations have made people's work easier in life.  In this paper, a maze solving robot is developed with independent mapping and localization skills.  In the first step, the maze-solving robot is designed with three ultrasonic distance sensors, which are used to detect the wall to prevent collisions and to detect obstacles.  The robot is also expected to be used in an environment that is inaccessible to humans.  In addition, there are places where the use of robots is the only way to reach the goal.  We have successfully implemented the ability to solve the maze on the robot.  The result of the experiment was that the robot could successfully solve the maze without hitting the walls, as well as save the correct path in its memory and send the saved path to the fellow robot at the end of the path, when it reaches the target.  In this design, It is possible to send positions to other embedded robots.
